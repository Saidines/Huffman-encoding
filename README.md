A simple C++ implementation of **Huffman Coding**, a lossless data compression algorithm. This program reads a text file, calculates character frequencies, builds a Huffman Tree, generates binary codes, and estimates compression by comparing bit sizes before and after.

## üîß Features

- Frequency analysis of characters in a file
- Construction of Huffman Tree using a priority queue
- Generation of binary Huffman codes
- Calculates and displays original vs. compressed size (in bits)
- Outputs Huffman codes per character

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Executable

### 1. Prepare an input text file

Create a text file (e.g. `input.txt`) with content you want to compress.

**Example (input.txt):**
 ./a.out 'input.txt'
